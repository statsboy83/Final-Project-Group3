The project was about classifying chest X-Ray images into 4 categories, Covid, Pneumonia, Lung Opacity and Normal. 

Everything I worked on is in the final report. Both Kristin and I worked on every single part of the project. We both trained, 
augmented images, ensembled and evaluated the models. In fact, doing things twice this way gave us the opportunity to compare runs. 
For example, she was training the models on the original data while I was training them on the augmented data or while she was 
training by freezing the pre-trained layers, I would try the same run without freezing. 

We both wrote the report and shared the slides so we truly worked on every aspect of this project together. 
Writing individual reports would literally triple the final report.  

This is the second project Iâ€™ve worked with her and she is a pleasure to work with, smart, hardworking, and driven.
